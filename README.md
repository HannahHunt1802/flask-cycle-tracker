### Note on Reused Templates
This project was built on a short deadline for a placement application, so I have
reused some of my existing code to speed up progress:
- The authentication system (login + register) that I completed and fully implemented. I used a partially completed Flask project 
that I am currently building at university, but all core functionality and integration were developed specifically for this project.
- The CSS+HTML structure base is pulled from my personal project (PlantApp) because it was easy to adapt 
and I like the styling.

All period-tracking logic - models, prediction logic, calendar integration, APIs, etc - 
was written fresh for this project.

### Future Improvements
- Cycle phases and analytics (e.g. follicular, luteal)
- Birth control features (e.g. mark placebo week)
- Symptom and mood tracking (e.g. flow, discharge, activity)
- Improve frontend-backend wiring for all UI actions
- Visual improvements (day/night mode - utilise my sun/moon assets and create more custom icons)
- Data export of cycle history

### Screenshots
